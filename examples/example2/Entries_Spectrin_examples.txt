#Those are the entries you can test when using 'Input_Spectrin.txt' as an input file.
#When prompted by the program, you can try these three entries successively in just one run: "cd00176", followed by "PF00435", and followed by "SM00150". You should obtain the same results as those stored in the 'Input_Spectrin_output' directory.
#Then you can compare the previous example by using "IPR002017" as an entry in another run. Your results should match those in the 'Input_Spectrin_output1' directory.
